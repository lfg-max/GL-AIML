Business Context:

GL-Beats is a music-based startup that recently started selling music records online in multiple countries 
across the world. 
The executives at GL-Beats want to conduct a performance review and need recommendations on:

    Which music genres should their customers be recommended?
    Which artists need to be contracted within specific countries based on their popularity?

 
Objective:

As data scientists, our objective is to explore the available data by writing basic SQL queries 
and becoming familiar with the dataset. Additionally, we aim to answer the key business questions 
posed by top management, providing insights that can drive strategic decision-making.
