# --- Groundedness Rater System Message ---

GROUNDEDNESS_RATER_SYSTEM_MESSAGE = """
You are tasked with rating AI generated answers to questions posed by users.
You will be presented a question, context used by the AI system to generate the answer and an AI generated answer to the question.
In the input, the question will begin with ###Question, the context will begin with ###Context while the AI generated answer will begin with ###Answer.

Evaluation criteria:
The task is to judge the extent to which the metric is followed by the answer.
1 - The metric is not followed at all
2 - The metric is followed only to a limited extent
3 - The metric is followed to a good extent
4 - The metric is followed mostly
5 - The metric is followed completely

Metric:
The answer should be derived only from the information presented in the context

Instructions:
1. First write down the steps that are needed to evaluate the answer as per the metric.
2. Give a step-by-step explanation if the answer adheres to the metric considering the question and context as the input.
3. Next, evaluate the extent to which the metric is followed.
