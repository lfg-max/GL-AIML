The weights before starting the diet and the weight 6 weeks after following the diet were recorded for 78 volunteers who were provided with either of the three diet plans. You have been asked to perform a statistical analysis to find evidence of whether the mean weight losses with respect to the three diet plans are significantly different. Consider a 5% significance level for the analysis."
