      "Second, moving tasks between teams is another point. By transferring some work from one team to another, like moving high-level tasks out of software into teaching boxes, Apple aimed for better collaboration and expertise alignment. That's the second characteristic.\n",
      "\n",
      "Third, integrating different areas of expertise seems important too. Combining design functions with other areas like news or video editing shows a focus on creating a cohesive system that benefits all teams. This is the third characteristic.\n",

It mentions that Apple had a functional organization where each business unit was led by general managers who were not experts in all areas. This approach allowed for cross-functional decision-making and collaboration among different departments. The company then evolved into a multidivisional structure as it grew, which further emphasized this leadership style.\n",
      "\n",
      "The article provides examples of how this approach worked. For instance, when Apple expanded its product portfolio, especially with new applications like News, Clips (video editing), Books, and Final Cut Pro, the VP of applications, Roger Rosner, had to manage a large number of projects. He assigned tasks based on expertise—some projects required deep knowledge in editorial content for News, others involved voice memos, which might require general management skills. This allowed him to handle each project effectively without overburdening himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another example is the transition from a functional organization to a multidivisional structure as Apple expanded its operations. This shift likely required Apple to reorganize their leadership teams and ensure that each division was led by experts in their specific areas, which aligns with the discretionary leadership model they introduced.\n",
      "\n",
      "The article also mentions that Apple's approach has been successful beyond just product innovation. It talks about how this method can lead to significant results even when the company is rapidly changing its environment. For example, the success of the iPhone and MacBooks was attributed in part to Apple's ability to manage a large number of projects with cross-functional expertise.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should make sure I'm not missing any specific examples or details from the article that illustrate this point. The key takeaway seems to be that by assigning responsibilities based on expertise and fostering collaboration, Apple could handle its growing complexity effectively, leading to successful innovations.\n",
